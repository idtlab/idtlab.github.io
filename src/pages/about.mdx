# About

In the Innovative Data Technologies (IDT) lab, we conduct research in all aspects of data management for science, 
including storage and I/O, file systems, metadata management, data quality assessment and improvement, 
performance analysis, performance tuning, data security, and energy-efficiency. 
Our emphasis is on developing systems and tools that make managing scientific data efficient and easy for scientists 
using high-performance computing (HPC), cloud, and edge computing systems.
