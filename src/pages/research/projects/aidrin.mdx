# AIDRIN: AI Data Readiness Inspector

<ProjectBadges projectId="aidrin" />

**AI Data Readiness Inspector (AIDRIN)** is a framework designed to assess the readiness of datasets for AI model training. It provides a structured evaluation across key dimensions that influence the success and reliability of AI systems.

AIDRIN includes a standalone user interface that allows users to upload their data and receive detailed evaluations across six core pillars of AI data readiness:

1. **Data Quality**
2. **Data Understandability and Usability**
3. **Data Governance**
4. **Impact of Data on AI Outcomes**
5. **Fairness and Bias**
6. **Privacy and Compliance**

Each pillar is assessed using established metrics from academic and industry literature, helping users identify potential issues before model development begins.

In addition to the standalone AIDRIN, it is integrated with **privacy-preserving federated learning** workflows through a collaboration with the [APPFL](https://appfl.ai/en/latest/index.html) framework. This integration enables secure, decentralized data readiness assessments without compromising data privacy. 

Documentation and code for this integration are available [here](https://appfl.ai/en/latest/tutorials/examples_dr_integration.html).
