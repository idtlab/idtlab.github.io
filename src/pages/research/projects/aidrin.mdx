# AIDRIN: AI Data Readiness Inspector

<ProjectBadges projectId="aidrin" />

**[AIDRIN (AI Data Readiness Inspector)](https://github.com/idtlab/aidrin)** is an **open-source framework** that helps researchers, developers, and organizations assess how ready their datasets are for **AI model training**.  
It provides a structured evaluation across key dimensions that determine the success, reliability, and ethical integrity of AI systems.

---

## Overview

AIDRIN offers both a **user-friendly interface** and a **programmatic API**, allowing users to upload datasets or connect to data sources for automated readiness assessments.

Each dataset is evaluated across **six core pillars** of AI data readiness:

1. **Data Quality**
2. **Data Understandability & Usability**
3. **Data Structure and Organization**
4. **Impact of Data on AI Outcomes**
5. **Fairness & Bias** 
6. **Data Governance**

Each pillar uses **established metrics** drawn from academic and industry standards, providing users with detailed diagnostic insights **before model development begins**.

In addition, users can extend AIDRIN by defining their own metrics and automated remedies, allowing **custom evaluation and correction** of dataset readiness challenges across different domains.

## Federated Learning Integration

AIDRIN integrates with **privacy-preserving federated learning** workflows via the [**APPFL**](https://appfl.ai/en/latest/index.html) framework.  
This enables organizations to **evaluate data readiness across distributed environments** without moving or exposing sensitive data.

Learn more about this integration in the official [APPFL documentation](https://appfl.ai/en/latest/tutorials/examples_dr_integration.html).

## Open Source

AIDRIN is **open source** and actively maintained.  
You can install, explore the source code, contribute, or report issues on **[GitHub](https://github.com/idtlab/aidrin)**
